- followed [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) to install docker locally and run the hello world
- still havent figured out how to not have to use sudo in front of everything
- `sudo docker run -it ubuntu bash` runs an ubuntu container locally

-instructions to containerize application [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/). frustratingly, instructions don't explain how to set up something
whole cloth new.

- How to get to the dockerfile?
- what goes into the dockerfile?
- can i launch the container in a GUI? I might be in some trouble if not, unless I can find some other way to start the program server
- dockerfile and command line documentation visible [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

- `sudo docker ps -a` lists containers on system
